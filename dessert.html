      <h2>Dessert: Creme Brûlée Cookies</h2>
      <p>I orginally made this recipe at the request of my family. Creme Brûlée isn't
        one of my favorites, but everyone else in my house likes it so I decided to try it.
        As it turned out, this cookie recipe became of the favorites of all the recipes I
        made during quarantine. With this particular recipe, it's best to eat them when they're
        fresh.</p>
