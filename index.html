      <h2>Lots of time = Lots of food</h2>
      <p> When the COVID-19 pandemic caused the world to lock down in March
        of 2020, everyone found ways to keep themselves occupied. While some
        people were watching <i>Tiger King</i>, learning to crochet, or making
        themselves a dalgona coffe, I was in the kitchen working on a litany of
        new recipes. Unlike most quarantine bakers I never tried sourdough, but I
        was able to find some great new recipes for all occasions. This site
        features some of my favorite recipes I was able to find. Happy baking!</p>
